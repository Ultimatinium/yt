### Notes

- All the patches here are the default and official patches by ReVanced.

- There are no Revanced YouTube Music in the releases section, it won't work as current patches doesn't include the YouTube Music Non-root (Micro G) patch track this ([pull request](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/pull/22) when it will get merged to ReVanced `main` branch and released). Don't open an issue here. Just rebuild ReVanced when music microG patch is available on [ReVanced Patches](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches/releases).
