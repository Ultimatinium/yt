#### Notes

<details>

- Buggy on Android 11 where all the applications are forcing to close.
- There are no `root` variant here, all the releases are `nonroot` variants.
- All the patches here are the default and [Official Patches](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches) by [ReVanced](https://github.com/revanced).
- All the app here are latest compatible versions from [APK Mirror](https://www.apkmirror.com) and [UpToDown](https://en.uptodown.com) website so there is no guarantee that the applications here are the latest update like on Google Play Store.
- This is includes beta versions (latest versions) that isn't yet tested by the [ReVanced Team](https://github.com/revanced).
