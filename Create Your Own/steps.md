#### Want to create your own?

If you want to create your own release, there are only few steps to do it.

Step 1:
Fork this repository.
- [How to fork a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)?
- To fork a repository on mobile browser, you can't see fork button on mobile view, you have to change to desktop mode first ([see how](https://youtu.be/0Dtd7-Swa8c)) then click the fork button.

Step 2:
After you forked this repository, go to GitHub Actions.

Step 3:
Run the Build ReVanced Twitter, ReVanced Reddit, ReVanced WarnWetter, ReVanced YouTube, or the Build All workflow to generate the applications.

Step 4:
Download the applications on the releases section after the workflow is finished.

#### Note

Don't forget to always check and update these files :

- [YouTube Version File](https://github.com/Ultimatinium/yt/blob/main/youtube/version.json)
- [YouTube Music arm64-v8a Version File](https://github.com/Ultimatinium/yt/blob/main/yt.music.64.v8a/version.json)

Those files are meant to be checked and updated to get the latest version on APK Mirror.
